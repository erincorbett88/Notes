# The Ultimate Redux Course
Beginner-friendly introduction to Redux.

This course is a Code With Mosh - [The Ultimate Redux Course](https://members.codewithmosh.com/courses/enrolled/783424).

- Redux is a state-management library for JavaScript applications. Can be used with React, Vue, Angular... doesn't care what library we use.
- There are other state management systems out there - Facebook uses Flux, and Google uses MobX. Redux grew out of Flux.
- All the state is stored inside a "store" - a central repository. So UI components don't manage their own state.
- Pros of Redux:
  - predictable state changes
  - centralized state
  - easy debugging
  - preserve page state
  - undo/redo pages
- Cons of Redux:
  - Adds complexity to code ("functional programming")
  - verbose/some boilerplate code
